# 📊 Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Models on Weather-Informed Energy Forecasting

This repository contains the code, datasets, and graphical abstract accompanying our paper:  
**"A comparative evaluation of time-series forecasting models for Energy Datasets"**

![Graphical Abstract](gra_abs_final.PNG)

In this work, we conduct a systematic comparative analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning models—such as **DLinear**, **NBEATS**, **NHITS**, **Autoformer**, **FEDformer**, and **Informer**—across a diverse collection of **24 energy-related time series**. These datasets are enriched with aligned **weather information** (e.g., temperature, wind speed, solar radiation) to reflect more realistic forecasting scenarios.

Our experiments evaluate model performance over **hourly**, **daily**, and **monthly** forecast horizons, considering both **short-** and **long-term** prediction tasks. We benchmark forecasting accuracy, training efficiency, and resource usage to provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's strengths and limitations.
